<!-- Hello, I am Albina! I am a Research Engineer at AIRI, where I work at dunnolab. I am broadly interested in AI, especially, Reinforcement learning. -->

Hi! I am a Research Scientist at AIRI’s dunnolab. My research focuses on machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning, with a particular interest in applying these techniques to real-world challenges like learning from raw videos or compiler optimization.

Before joining AIRI, I worked as a Machine Learning Research Engineer at Huawei’s Hisilicon division. I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from Skoltech, where I conducted research on leader-guided evacuation models combining active matter and reinforcement learning. During my Bachelor’s studies in Applied Mathematics and Physics at MIPT, I explored high-energy astrophysics and topological clustering of protein structures during internships at RRI Space Research Institute and  Max Planck MPI-CBG Dresden.
